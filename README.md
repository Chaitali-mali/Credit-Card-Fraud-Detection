# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

🚨 **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard – Excel Project** 📊💳

I’m excited to share my latest **Data Analytics** project focused on detecting **credit card fraud** using real-world transaction data! 💡

---

🔍 **Project Introduction:**

Credit card fraud poses a significant global financial threat. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze transaction patterns and identify fraudulent behavior — *in a clear and insightful way*.

---

📊 **Dataset Overview:**

* **Total Records:** 284,807 transactions
* **Features:**

  * `Time` – Seconds since the first transaction
  * `V1–V28` – PCA-transformed (anonymized) features
  * `Amount` – Transaction value in USD
  * `Class` – 0 (Legit) | 1 (Fraud)

---

📌 **Dashboard Highlights:**

* Real-time fraud filtering by **Time** and **Amount**
* **Pie Chart**: Transaction Amount Breakdown
* **Bar Chart**: V1 Feature vs. Class
* **3D Column Chart**: Time vs. V4 Analysis
* Fraud detection using pivot tables, slicers & charts
* Trend insights between normal and fraudulent transactions

---

📈 **Key Insights:**

* Fraud transactions often show distinct **time** and **amount** patterns
* PCA components (V1–V28) reveal valuable anomaly behavior
* The fraud class (1) is a **minority**, but high-risk group

---

🧠 **Recommendations:**

* Monitor **high-value** and **off-hour** transactions
* Combine **PCA insights** with ML models for better accuracy
* Use dashboards to support **real-time fraud detection**

🛠️ **Tools Used:**
Microsoft Excel | Pivot Tables | Charts | Data Filters | Slicers

📁 **Dataset:** Anonymized Credit Card Transactions**
