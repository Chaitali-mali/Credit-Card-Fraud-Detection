🚨 Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard – Excel Project 📊💳

I’m excited to share my latest data analytics project focused on detecting credit card fraud using real-world transaction data! 💡

🔍 What I Did:
✔️ Built an interactive Excel dashboard
✔️ Used pivot tables, slicers & visualizations
✔️ Analyzed time, transaction amount & PCA-transformed features (V1–V28)
✔️ Identified trends between normal and fraudulent transactions

📈 Key Highlights:

Real-time fraud filtering by amount & time

Class distribution: Fraud (1) vs. Normal (0)

Visual insights into high-risk PCA components

🛠️ Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, Pivot Charts, Data Filters
📁 Dataset: Credit Card Transactions (Anonymized)
