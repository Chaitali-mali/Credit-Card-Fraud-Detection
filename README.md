🚨 Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard – Excel Project 📊💳

I’m excited to share my latest data analytics project focused on detecting credit card fraud using real-world transaction data! 💡

Introduction :

Credit card fraud is a growing financial threat globally.
Data analytics can help detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.
Objective: Analyze transaction patterns to identify fraud using Excel-based dashboard.

Dataset Overview :

 Rows: 284,807 transactions

Features:

1 Time – Seconds since first transaction
2 V1 to V28 – PCA-transformed features (anonymized)
3 Amount – Transaction amount in USD
4 Class – 0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud

 Data Fields Explained :

 | Feature | Description                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Time    | Elapsed time in seconds                        |
| V1-V28  | PCA components – sensitive features anonymized |
| Amount  | Transaction value                              |
| Class   | Fraud indicator (0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud)         |

Dashboard Insights :

1 Interactive filters for Time and Amount
2 Fraud detection through aggregated values
3 PCA component insights (e.g., V1 vs. Class)
4 Fraud count and total amounts visualized

Key Visualizations :

1 Pie Chart: Transaction Amount Breakdown
2 Bar Chart: V1 Feature vs. Class Label
3 3D Column Chart: Time vs. V4 Analysis

🔍 What I Did:

1 Built an interactive Excel dashboard.
2 Used pivot tables, slicers & visualizations.
3 Analyzed time, transaction amount & PCA-transformed features (V1–V28).
4 Identified trends between normal and fraudulent transactions.

📈 Key Highlights:

1 Real-time fraud filtering by amount & time
2 Class distribution: Fraud (1) vs. Normal (0)
3 Visual insights into high-risk PCA components

Data Source: Credit Card Fraud Dataset

Recommendations :

1 Use real-time filters to flag potential fraud
2 Monitor high-amount and unusual time patterns
3 Combine PCA components with machine learning for better accuracy


🛠️ Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, Pivot Charts, Data Filters

📁 Dataset: Credit Card Transactions (Anonymized)
